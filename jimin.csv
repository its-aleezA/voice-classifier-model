The moment we first met?
We were so shy and awkward back then
Now that I look back
We've come this far in just a blink of an eye
We walked it together, alongside each other
At times, I fell and shed tears
We comforted each other, with a pat on the back
Gazing at one another with tears in our eyes
Calling out each other's names
Starting on June 13
To the us of thе present, herе and now
Even if you're not here
At the same place, always

Don't have to worry now
Letting go of your hand for a moment
But it's only a small comma in our story
Just call my name out loud
Until the days tinge purple once again

'Cause anytime you want me (I'll be)
Right here where you call me (I'll be)
I could never let you go
Never let you go
Whenever you need me (I'll be)
If you believe me (I'll be)
I'll never let you go
Never let you go

Whenever it rains, I'll remember the times I sang in the rain
Whenever it snows, I'll cherish how you smiled for me in the snow
On the spring day, we meet again, I'll tell you everything I couldn't before
My love, my babe, forever by your side
Seven equals one, right, our hearts still beat as one
Close your eyes for just a second, I'll be standing in front of you, oh

Don't have to worry now
Letting go of your hand for a moment
But it's only a small comma in our story

Whenever it snows, I'll cherish how you smiled for me in the snow
On the spring day, we meet again, I'll tell you everything I couldn't before

Seven equals one, right, our hearts still beat as one

The moment we first met?
We were so shy and awkward back then
Now that I look back
We've come this far in just a blink of an eye
We walked it together, alongside each other
At times, I fell and shed tears
We comforted each other, with a pat on the back
Gazing at one another with tears in our eyes
Calling out each other's names
Starting on June 13
To the us of thе present, herе and now
Even if you're not here
At the same place, always

Don't have to worry now
Letting go of your hand for a moment
But it's only a small comma in our story
Just call my name out loud
Until the days tinge purple once again

'Cause anytime you want me (I'll be)
Right here where you call me (I'll be)
I could never let you go
Never let you go
Whenever you need me (I'll be)
If you believe me (I'll be)
I'll never let you go
Never let you go

Whenever it rains, I'll remember the times I sang in the rain
Whenever it snows, I'll cherish how you smiled for me in the snow
On the spring day, we meet again, I'll tell you everything I couldn't before
My love, my babe, forever by your side
Seven equals one, right, our hearts still beat as one
Close your eyes for just a second, I'll be standing in front of you, oh
