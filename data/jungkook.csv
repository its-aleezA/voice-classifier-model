JUNGKOOK-1,Still With You,Still With You,2020-06-05,1,Still With You,,Still With You,"That faint voice of yours that grazed me
Please call my name one more time
I’m standing still under the frozen light, but
I will walk towards you, step by step
Still with you

A pitch dark room
I shouldn’t get used to it
But I’m used to it again
The low-pitched sound of the air conditioner
If I don’t have this, I might just fall apart

We laugh together, we cry together
These simple feelings were everything I had
When will it be?
If I see you again
I will look into your eyes
And say, ""I missed you""

In a rapturous memory
The rain pours even when I dance alone
By the time this mist clears
I'll run with my feet wet
So hug me then

The moon looks lonely
Like it's crying in the bright night sky
Even though I always know the morning will come
I want to stay in your sky like a star

Every day, every moment
If I knew this was gonna happen
I would have remembered more of them
When will it be?
If I see you again
I will look into your eyes
And say, ""I missed you""

In a rapturous memory
The rain pours even when I dance alone
By the time this mist clears
I'll run with my feet wet
So hug me then

Behind the faint smile that looked at me
I will draw a beautiful purple shade
Though our footsteps may be out of step
I want to walk this path with you
Still with you",FALSE,FALSE,,JUNGKOOK,FALSE,KOR,FALSE,FALSE,0i3baFZqWSrjjgTWrhKunB,239905,0eFMbKCRw8KByXyWBw8WO7,0.529,0.469,1,-6.967,0,0.0358,0.0899,1.53E-05,0.831,0.344,87.864,4,,

When did things start to go wrong?
I can't remember at all
I whisper as I hide myself in this small room
Darkness is my only friend (Only friend)
My hand reaching out for salvation
Am I strange?
A room stained with blood
Please, somebody save me

Hide in the moonlight
There ain't no miracles
My hopes are humble
Hide in the moonlight
I'm not asking for a lot
But I guess it's too much
At the end of this sleepless twilight
Feels like I strayed through this nightmare
With my eyes wide opеn
Came like a miracle, look likе a miracle
Just like a miracle, those few words

You are my fate
No words can express it enough
Salvation that saved a wearied me
Is that easier to grasp
Those few words that saved me
I'll be by your side after many nights

I'll stay by your side even if my feet bleed

Please, you stay alive

Please, you stay alive
(Woah-oh-oh, woah)
Please, you stay alive

The shadow is growing bigger
But it's okay because you are my big light
Because you are the profit in my life
Just smile like you always do
You resemble me so much
I resemble you so much
At times, I get scared for no reason
Why am I feeling like this?

At the end of this endless nightmare
That I don't know if it'll ever end
You raise me up every day

Breeze is already blowing
The last cold snap is going out
The days were getting longer and longer
But my days were still going on, and on, and on
I got wet in the sun shower and looked up at the night sky

It was quite a lonely night
In the blink of an eye
The dark faded out
Blooming under the sunlight
Memories with me and you

All these lights are colored in by you
All these times are precious due to you
Four sеasons have passed with you
Four scents wеre left 'cause of you
All the reasons why I can laugh out
All the reasons why I sing this song
Thankful to be by your side now
I'll try to shine brighter than now

Will it disappear?
Is it a dream?
I toss and turn
Falling asleep again
Can it last forever?
My bitter heart
I try to sooth it
And get stuck in the night

A quite lonely night
The dark clouds scatter suddenly
Engraved under the silver of light
The warmth you left behind
All the light is colored by you
And my time becomes perfect
Again after four seasons
It's getting deeper again
The reason I smile
And I'm able to sing this song
Thank you for being by my side
I'll shine brighter

On a starry night
Hope my you sleep tight
