An age without a hitch

A life that makes me anticipate living

All that was foul was now unleashed upon the world.

Pandora, unable to undo what she had done, fell into despair.

As she grieved, she heard a feeble quiver from the box.

She lifted the lid once more, and out fluttered a small, bright, most beautiful creature she had ever seen.

It flapped its delicate wings as it danced around Pandora, lightly brushing against her shoulder.

Pandora immediately felt her angst melt away and her heart glow with warmth.

It was Hope that was kept in the innermost nook of the box.

It trailed behind the miasma of darkness, assuaging their ill effects on humankind.

It flapped its delicate wings as it danced around Pandora, lightly brushing against her shoulder.

Pandora immediately felt her angst melt away and her heart glow with warmth.

You've asked me dozens of times
Am I really like that?
Hope, positivity, always smiling face
I just thought it was something I could do
So my music, my speech, my feel
I made it myself
But, doubts arise
I ask J-Hope
""Can you keep the parts you talked about?""
Maybe it's not my own will
I was born from countless environments
Ayy, boldly shine your persona
Hold up

(Can I do this?)
Let me think
(Can I do it?)
Even in this case

What if, what if, what if, what if
What if I have no hope?
What if, what if, what if, what if
What if I have no dream?
What if, what if, what if, what if
What if I have no passion?
What if, what if, what if, what if
What if I have no vision?

How you doin', bro?
Looks like you're living well these days, swaggering around
What are storms and trials to you?
You've only climbed up the еntire staircase
That might not be known
Yеt you've got it all now
Money, fame, even the following of good people
To love oneself and have hope
Even if all that is stripped away and you're at rock bottom
Can you say it? (I wish)
Hold up

(Can I do this?)
Let me think
(Can I do it?)
Even in this case

What if, what if, what if, what if
What if I have no hope?
What if, what if, what if, what if
What if I have no dream?
What if, what if, what if, what if
What if I have no passion?
What if, what if, what if, what if
What if I have no vision?


But the truth is
I could see those visions in my sky
I could find a hand that always
Held me through this ride
Progression was something
I was hoping for
My prayers are answered every day
Taking one step at a time, keep moving forward
(J be the hope)
(J be the hope)

When the life I've lived is reflected on my face
I sneak a peek at the mirror, and what I see is not bad
I relaxed my shoulders, to be upright
Dozens of given motivation
At the intersection connecting each neuron
I carefully assemble the meaning and reason of life
The driving distance of a lightning delivery ball
Whether it be short or long is up to each's decision
I no longer embrace bombs
I've passed the ball on to my crew
While I play catchball with my look-alike son on weekends
Metro on the outskirts
The metronome next to my childhood piano
Matching it became my job, and the payout keeps pilin' up
Still on thin ice
Anxiety about the future lurks beneath the stage like a ghost
I scream, shout, then come back
To relax with a bland home-cooked meal
Make some white noise

I'll tell you again
We'll never ever give up, forever
I'll say it again
We'll always be alive to move us
I’ll tell you again
We'll never ever give up, forever

Look at ya, mad like, how she get the best spot
'Cause you can learn to flow
But passion it can't be taught
I got a passion for the game
