Like my lyrics, it was like that every day
Formulas and equations that couldn’t give me an answer
Those things eventually turned into many wounds*
It wouldn’t let me see the stars hidden behind its light
Killing me like this day by day
Meaninglessly, I’d devote my whole day on number games like grades**
I just wanted to succeed
Because that was all I constantly heard about from other people
I thought the mirage of happiness would be caught there
But sitting in front of my desk, I wasn’t happy for a single moment
Without my mom knowing, I slipped a blank page into my workbook
Writing down my identity to the drum bass
Breathing, which feels different from when I’m getting my grades
Even if I’d get 1st place my heart didn’t feel at peace
Is it really important to want the same thing others want?
Rather than living an entire life full of sorrowful sighs,
I decided to take off these restrictions and choose the life where I could just breathe***
Everyone pointed their fingers, the insincere people around me
My dream is to give my voice to everyone,
Regardless of what situation I’m in. With my music and my lyrics
I don’t know what you’ll feel while listening to this
It’s alright if you curse at me because you’ll eventually seek me out again
That’s right, even after 7 years, with a 50 000 won mic
In the corner of my room as ever and the mixtape that I put together on my own
Some say I’m fake, that’s right I’ll acknowledge my dark past
I could try and justify it but it won’t ever happen again
Yeah I be real This moment that I desired for so much
The pedal that I stepped on for 7 years has finally been oiled
You can’t kill. Come take it if you do wanna piece of me
Just tell me through music, I don’t need a different field
If you really think you ready to fly with my power
This is what R is about fella the time is now

A lot of things change when you stop caring about what others think
You were born your own owner, why are you trying to become a slave

That living is just continuing to realise how lonely you are
Regardless of how many are or aren’t around you
The little me inside myself was always lonely
Why isn’t there an antonym for loneliness?
It might be because there isn’t a moment in one’s life when they aren’t lonely
Even though your surroundings may seem incredibly noisy
Moments when you have to be alone will always come back to find you
Yeah that’s a life

We live in danger,
In return for being able to see this beautiful world
Not even bulletproof vests, street lamps, sturdy cars
Can perfectly protect us from death
From the moment everyone is born
Everyone is guaranteed to die, which makes life more beautiful
Like how light needs shadow to truly be light
Like how the sun shines after a rough storm

Life, fall in love
Life is getting hurt by other people
And becoming lonely with the wind
We wanna be right
But always wrong
Were we born in order to be wrong
Is life perhaps this way
(We’ll never know what tomorrow will be like)
(Even if this building collapses, we can’t avoid it)
We tryna be bright
But always dark
Even if you feel you’ve lived long enough
You’ll still never know

The world is just one page of décalcomanie*
A punk I thought was on my side can turn into an even more vicious enemy
Like folding paper, relationships become a done deal when you fold them
In no time, they’re on the other side mocking me
Completely the same, but child, there’s no need to be mad
In front of money, some parents don’t even have kids 
We have to burn ourselves up, because the world is so cold
So that no one can freeze us, even if I may hurt myself 
Perhaps there is no such thing as right or wrong
But what we always ended up learning was that
Stepping on, holding back, erasing and hating someone
Fuck all the peace and love I know that those are the enemies of success
As if it’s so obvious
Those quotes that I hear being used like logic
Make me even sadder. But so what, even I am all talk
I am merely a breeze that passes someone by

Life, fall in love
Life is getting hurt by other people
And becoming lonely with the wind
We wanna be right
But always wrong
Were we born in order to be wrong
Is life perhaps this way

Were we born so we could live
Were we born so we could die
Were we born so we could live
Were we born so we could die
Are we living in order to die
Are we dying in order to live
The name-tag attached to my name
Is it life
Or death

In my world, I’m a god, that’s not a deal
If we go back rank, I’m 1
How you feel babe, do you believe in your own ownership?
Are you balancing well the see-saw of rationality and sensibility?
Everyone wants to become their own leader
But you have to believe in yourself to become your own leader
Bad thoughts and pessimistic rationalization is MSG
It might seem to be right but it erases your true taste
We’re so used to just looking out at the world 
Even though I have a galaxy within me
Wherever I am, whatever I do
I believe I believe
Wherever I am, I look out for myself
I believe I believe

You know I believe in love, believe in hope
Believe in thoughts that i got while i be living this life
Livin this stuff like breathin
Sometimes I get confused too, about who I am
Sometimes I feel like an angel and sometimes like a devil
But everything coexists. Positive and negativity
What leads the world and me is ultimately the synergy of those two
All the wandering, searching for identity, sometimes confused
Those moments that were so empty they were almost confusing, are now lovable 
When you get confused about what what’s right or wrong
Think about what makes you want to live
This muzik, passion, all the beautiful places out there, and fashion
Whisky that pretends to be mature uh mom you kiss me
I hope you, too, make a meaning that you can lean and rest on
All these roads that seem the same yet different all lead to death
At the end of the day, we’re all just on top of time’s palm
(Keep walking’) I’d rather believe in myself than forget

Wherever I am, whatever I’m doing
I believe I believe
Wherever I am, I protect myself
I believe I believe

Even if people don’t believe in their own dreams, when others tell them to dream something, they all believe it
In books, on TV, or internet, any dog or cow is leader leader
I’m not lightly saying to follow your chest instead of your head
Since it’s closer to your heart anyway
Even though you can hide your face, you can’t hide your heartbeat
You can hide your face boy but you can’t hide your heartbeat
It’s one life to live and one heart to give
Who the fuck ya want to be? Got no life to miss
